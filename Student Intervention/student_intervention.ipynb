    "**Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "The three supervised learning models that are going to be used for this particular problem are the following: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Applications: This particular algorithm has seen applications in spam filtering, such as Paul Graham's attempts (http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html and http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html). Which leveraged the use of content based filters, that is, identifying probabilities of whether an email is spam based on specific features such as word occurrence in the body and header, size, links, etc. The implementation of the algorithm at hand on these situations is fairly straight forward and simple. One other application pertains more directly to the problem at hand, Kotsiantis, Pierrakeas, Pintelas (2003) used different Machine Learning Techniques in identifying the possibility of increased prevention of Student Dropouts in Distance Learning given data on the 'Informatics Course' of the Hellenic Open University. They found that the Naive Bayes algorithm was successfully used and yielded good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: The model's strengths are that it is of fairly easy and non-complex implementation. The feature probabilities allow for an understanding of the different influences each feature poses to the classification output, granting a somewhat less \"black box\" approach to the algorithm's inner working and a clearer picture of what features are more prone to influence the prediction. This would allow, for this specific case, a clearer picture as to what are the features that are influencing the most the student's passing/failing chance on the final exam, and hence make way for the possibility of identifying these features and improving them. Although not akin to the dataset at hand, the model tends to perform well with very large number of feature sets, and is very efficient at handling these larger datasets, which in turn is one of the reasons for its usage in cases where there is a need for an accurate but fast prediction with many features, like the case of text classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: The model assumes conditionally independent features, meaning a specific feature input should not be probabilistically determined by some other feature value. In real world situations, this is not necessarily the case, as features tend to have a more complex nature and tend do not always be independent. An example stems from text classification as the combination of words might not necessarily share the same meaning or influence as the words do when separated. When the features are not independent, the algorithm's accuracy will tend to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Candidate: As demonstrated above, given the data at hand, the Naive Bayes model serves as a good candidate for this problem. The dataset is fairly small, meaning the algorithm should ideally be of less complexity, as to avoid overfitting. Given the objective of the study is to increase the ratio of students passing the final exam, it is important that the solution provides not only an accurate prediction of passing chances but also a clear indication as to what are the factors that influence this prediction. This way, the school board/directors would be able to identify what are the features that most influence this prediction and target them specifically. This way, not only the school is able to identify students that are likely to end up failing the final exam but make changes that reduce this statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Applications: One famous application of the decision tree is in BP's GasOIL system for separating gas and oil on offshore platforms (MIT Course Notes, Decision Trees, Cynthia Rudin, https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-097-prediction-machine-learning-and-statistics-spring-2012/lecture-notes/MIT15_097S12_lec08.pdf). The system in place had been \"man-made\" over a 10 year span and the new decision tree solution ended up outperforming field experts and saving BP millions of dollars. (1986). Because this model follows a very clear conception of decision making, it can be said that it is widely used in mundane situations, albeit unknowingly, for example in a doctor's thought process of investigating a disease, that is, asking a series of questions and eliminating possibilities based on the feedback or test, and arriving on some diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Because Decision Trees follow this fairly linear elimination process, which is replicated constantly on general decision making in a day to day basis, the interpretation for a non machine-learning person is intuitive and usually easy to follow, although more complex decision trees with many nodes can end up being fairly convoluted. In general though, this ease of interpretation allows for the identification of important features and more specifically, through the Information Gain formula, it is possible to create a decision tree that points toward features that are most likely to influence the outcome or prediction. This key feature identification is important in situations in which gaining an easy to understand insight on the data features is necessary and when the objective is not only to predict the outcome of some new data but to make changes to the system in place in order to increase the likelihood of some outcome, which is true for the case at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Decision Trees are prone to overfitting the data. In cases in which the dataset features are fairly complex, the algorithm will tend to overfit the training data and thus reduce the accuracy in which it predicts new data points, hence the trade-off on accuracy with \"pruning\" techniques is usually necessary. Given very large datasets and increased feature complexity, training a Decision Tree algorithm can also be very slow. Small modifications to the input data can issue very large changes to the tree, meaning the robustness and reliability of the algorithm can be compromised if the information the decision tree feeds from is not entirely precise. (http://www.brighthubpm.com/project-planning/106005-disadvantages-to-using-decision-trees/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Candidate: Once more the decision for using this model was aimed at providing a more intuitive approach and a response to the school on important features that influence the final exam passing/failing outcome. Once again, the objective of this project would not only be to provide an accurate prediction for the passing chance of some new student given the feature values, but also a better understanding of the underlying effects that the different features have on the chances the student will pass the final exam or not. This way, this algorithm would be able to point the direction as to what are the features of interest that deserve being further looked at and targeted in order to increase the ratio of students passing the final exam. Given the data does not seem to be complex and the amount of data is fairly small, Decision Trees would not pose a problem of large memory consumption and convoluted branching out interpretations, although the issue of overfitting would be important to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Real World Application: k-NN has been used in several different fields, usually linked to some kind of pattern based classification problem, like for example on the breast cancer diagnosis problem, Sarkar, Leong (2000), which demonstrated that k-NN provided classification results that were 1.17% better than the best results known for the problem at the time. One other application was in the prediction of economic events, as demonstrated on Bafandeh, Bolandraftar (2013) which followed this pattern based intuition to determine the effects of companies' financial distress on stakeholders, also demonstrating positive results. Other pattern based approaches like recommendation systems (Music, Movies, Series, Books) can also be tackled with a k-NN Classifier, as the objective is to identify similar data points and draw practical inferences on the predicted user tastes.\n",

    "Strengths: Following suit to the previously chosen algorithms, the k-NN classifier is also a fairly intuitive, non \"black-box\" approach, that allows for a simpler implementation and understanding of the reasons that lead to some prediction of an outcome based on the features. In this case, the algorithm predicts an outcome based on the most similar k points. Because the computational part of k-NN is held in the classification of a data point, the performance of the algorithm is fairly good, although for large training data sets, the computation can be very taxing. However, this is not true for the case at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses: Determining the distance function that is most appropriate to the problem can be quite unclear, and given this choice might greatly influence the predictive power of the algorithm, this can produce a weak accuracy. One other problem is that all features contribute to the similarity between the data points, and if the weights are not properly tuned, the model might incorrectly predict classifications. As mentioned previously, for large datasets, the computational cost can be very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Candidate: Following the importance attributed to the ease of interpretation of results and explanatory power of the algorithm regarding important features, k-NN seems like a good candidate for this specific study. The dataset available is not large and complex, which implies that one of the model's weaknesses, computational cost for large datasets, should not be a problem. Given the importance of prediction and understanding of feature importance, this model should be rather intuitive. Seeing as the problem at hand fits within a pattern classification problem, that is, identifying students more prone to failing the final exam should be a result of some underlying pattern, this model should be able to correctly identify these trends or patterns in the data and make accurate predictions based on the given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary: From the problem's description I set out to identify models that would be good at two specific tasks, working with small datasets and still presenting fairly accurate results, and demonstrating the underlying cause for the prediction in an intuitive way, that is, not being a \"black box\" kind of prediction. Therefore, although there are other candidate models that could surely pose good results, I opted for these three classifiers.\n",

With the training set, we then run the algorithm on this training set and from the different combination of features present in the data, the model identifies what are the weights associated with each feature. That is, how much does each feature influence the outcome of whether a student passes the final exam or not. We then use this combination of probabilities that was captured by the algorithm from the training set and test it on the remaining testing subset.
